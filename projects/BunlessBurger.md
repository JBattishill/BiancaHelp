### Method:

Divide the beef mince into 125g portions and shape them into patties.

Season both sides with salt and pepper.

Cook the beef patties for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked to your preference.

During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on top of each burger and let it melt.

Assemble the burgers, place a lettuce leaf on a plate and top it with a slice of tomato. Place a pattie on top of the tomato and add everyone's desired additional toppings.

Wrap another lettuce leaf around the burger and toppings, use toothpicks to secure it if needed.

Serve and enjoy!
