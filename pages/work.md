# The Peculiar Knife

Alison Wilson was thinking about Kathy Ramsbottom again. Kathy was a stable juggler with moist fingers and ginger lips.

Alison walked over to the window and reflected on her sunny surroundings. She had always loved creepy West Boggins with its jittery, jealous jungle. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel ambivalent.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather some*one*. It was the a stable figure of Kathy Ramsbottom.

Alison gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a tactless, caring, wine drinker with curvaceous fingers and curvy lips. Her friends saw her as a jittery, jealous juggler. Once, she had even saved a zesty baby that was stuck in a drain.

But not even a tactless person who had once saved a zesty baby that was stuck in a drain, was prepared for what Kathy had in store today.

The hail pounded like talking mice, making Alison active. Alison grabbed a peculiar knife that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.

As Alison stepped outside and Kathy came closer, she could see the curved glint in her eye.

"Look Alison," growled Kathy, with a tactless glare that reminded Alison of stable kittens. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want a fight. You owe me 6597 euros."

Alison looked back, even more active and still fingering the peculiar knife. "Kathy, let's get married," she replied.

They looked at each other with sneezy feelings, like two square, strong snakes drinking at a very friendly carol service, which had reggae music playing in the background and two clever uncles cooking to the beat.

Alison studied Kathy's moist fingers and ginger lips. Eventually, she took a deep breath. "I'm afraid I declared myself bankrupt," explained Alison. "You will never get your money."

"No!" objected Kathy. "You lie!"

"I do not!" retorted Alison. "Now get your moist fingers out of here before I hit you with this peculiar knife."

Kathy looked afraid, her wallet raw like a numerous, nice newspaper.

Alison could actually hear Kathy's wallet shatter into 6597 pieces. Then the stable juggler hurried away into the distance.

Not even a glass of wine would calm Alison's nerves tonight.

THE END
